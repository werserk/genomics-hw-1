# Data layout (best practices):
# - raw/: source data (may be versioned if small / required for homework)
# - public/: final artifacts intended to be shared / checked in
# - external/: large third-party downloads (do not commit)
# - interim/: scratch/intermediate results (do not commit)
# - processed/: derived datasets (typically reproducible, do not commit)
